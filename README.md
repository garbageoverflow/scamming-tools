# Scamming Tools
Some basic scamming tools

1. css-key-logger
    - a basic key logger
    - not my original idea
    - very cool idea
2. desktop
    - perfect if you're dealing with dumb victims
    - looks like a real windows 10 desktop
    - work in progress
3. domain-checker
    - checks if the script is loaded from your domain, or if it's stolen.
    - code is obfuscated and really hard to decypher
4. js-key-logger
    - another poorly made keylogger
    - please don't use this
    - better examples were given
